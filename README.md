# Click Games


This is just a couple of games (not really games) that should only require a mouse.  

The first game will be a clicks per second thing.  
The second will be a reaction time similar to humanbenchmark one.  

Usage:

```console
gcc -o nob nob.c
./nob
```
Check `./nob --help` for flags you can set.
